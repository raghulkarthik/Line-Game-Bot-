                                           [Connect 4 Reinforcement Learning Bot]
                                        -----       Project Overview     -----
This project aims to develop an intelligent Connect 4 bot using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can make optimal moves and compete effectively in the Connect 4 game. The bot is trained to learn strategic gameplay and improve its performance over time.

* List the prerequisites that users need to install before they can use your project. Include information about Python versions, libraries, and any other dependencies.
# Example:
# - Python 3.7+
# - TensorFlow 2.0+

* Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project.
# - python -m pip install numpy                                                                                                       
    {This command is used in python to run the pip package manager module (-m pip) and it instructs to install the numpy package. After running this command, NumPy should be installed and ready for use in your Python environment.}
                                              >            {Usage}              <
*                        Explain how users can use your project. Provide examples and usage guidelines.

- Training the Bot to train the Connect 4 bot, run the following command:
# - python train_bot.py

You can customize training parameters, RL algorithms, and neural network architectures in the train_bot.py file.
- Playing Against the Bot to play against the trained Connect 4 bot, use the following command:
  # - python play_game.py
  -  Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves. You can adjust the bot's difficulty and behavior in the play_game.py file.
